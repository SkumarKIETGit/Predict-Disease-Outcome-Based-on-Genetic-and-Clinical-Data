# Predict Disease Outcome Based on Genetic and Clinical Data

## Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of a particular disease based on a combination of genetic markers, clinical symptoms, and lifestyle factors using supervised machine learning. The model classifies patients into risk categories, helping healthcare providers make better-informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Genetic Data**: Genetic markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are used to predict disease risk.
- **Clinical Data**: Includes patient symptoms, age, medical history, and test results.
- **Lifestyle Data**: Factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking habits.
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) are used to classify patients into risk categories.
- **Risk Prediction**: The model predicts whether a patient is at risk for a particular disease based on the combined data.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare the Data

The dataset contains three separate files:

- **genetic_data.csv**: Genetic markers for each patient.
- **clinical_data.csv**: Patient symptoms, medical history, and test results.
- **lifestyle_data.csv**: Lifestyle factors of patients.

Ensure all datasets are cleaned and merged correctly before training the model.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### 3. Model Training

After preprocessing, use the `model_training.py` script to train a machine learning model on the data.

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

### 4. Model Evaluation

After training, the `evaluation.py` script can be used to assess the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```bash
python src/evaluation.py
```

### 5. Model Inference

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the risk of new patients by loading the trained model from `trained_model.pkl` and providing new data.

```python
import pickle

# Load the trained model
with open('models/trained_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Predict for new data
new_data = [patient_data]  # Replace with actual patient data
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
```
